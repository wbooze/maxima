Explaining the use of multi-precision quadrature using MPFR / lisp
on windows, Allegro CL 8.0 (perhaps the free "Express" version), and generic arithmetic.

First, make a directory somewhere.  call it generic. Download all the
files that are mentioned below.  For the case of fasl files, they
should probably be produced locally to correspond to the exact version
of Lisp that you are using. 
produce it: in Lisp, assuming the directory is c:\generic...

:cd c:/generic      
:cf ga.lisp
:cf mpfr.lisp
:cf quad-fast.lisp

Next, here's what to do for running quadrature. Load the program and set the package to mpfr
:cd c:/generic
:ld mysysquad.lisp
:pa :mpfr

(int_gs_l5bf #'exp 10)  ;; use gaussian 10-point integration for -1 to 1 of exp(x). 53 bits

(set-prec 600)  ;; set precision to 600 bits

(int_gs_l5bf #'exp 10) ;; try again
(int_gs_l5bf #'exp 80) ;; try again

(time (int_gs_l5bf #'exp 80))

This should be exp(1)-exp(-1), approx.
