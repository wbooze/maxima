Heh.  I never remember either.

(asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :oct)

or

(asdf:oos 'asdf:compile-op :oct)


Not sure, but I think load-op just loads the files without compiling 
(but if fasls exist, the fasls are loaded).

If you want to use defsystem (which is what I use), you can say

(mk:oos "oct" :compile) to compile or (mk:oos "oct" :load) to load 
(without compiling?).

I need to change the code to use safety > 0 for Allegro.  I'll do that soon.
