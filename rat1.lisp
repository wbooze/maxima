#| A fpe is a (possibly) factored polynomial expression implemented
 as a list of pairs of polynomials and exponents. For example,

                             2  2         4
                   12 (x + 1) (y  + y - 5)

 is represented as a list of three pairs, the first pair being the
 the number 12 and the exponent 1, the second being the 
 polynomial (x + 1) and the exponent 2, and the third being the
 polynomial (y^2 + y - 5) and the exponent 4.
 Currently, the first pair is always  an integer with exponent 1.

 Although the polynomials could have coefficients in any ring
 for some operations, the idea of gcd as used here assumes coefs form a
 unique factorization domain, and therefore it is principally useful
 to have integer coefficients.  (Rationals are not a UFD since
  1/2*2 = 1/3*3 = 1 etc.)

 Getting back to our representation --
 There is a first pair that always looks like (integer . 1).
 Subsequent pairs consist of
 distinct polynomials with integer coefficients, and
 exponents which are integers >= 1.
 It is not required that polys  be squarefree, monic, irreducible
 or restricted in some other ways.  Examples of possible pairs:

  ( (x^2) . 2)  ;   ( (3 x^2 - 3 x) . 1)
  actually, the polynomials will be in some better form, so it is
 more accurate to depict these examples as 
  ( #(1 0 0 1) . 2)  ;  ( #(1 0 -3 3) . 1)   where x <--> 1

 The polynomials in an fpe, except for intermediate forms produced
 during gcd computation, are maintained in lexicographically
 increasing order. Note that two polynomials in fpe form 
 may not be IDENTICAL even though they are mathematically
 equivalent, because of different factorings.

 For example,  ((1 . 1) ( (x^2+2x+1) . 1))  and ((1 . 1) ((x+1) . 2))
 are equivalent but not identical.  If they were added together,
 the result would be  (if we refrained from computing
 gcds)
  ((1 . 1) ((2x^2+4*x+2) . 1))

 Another equivalent answer (more effort to compute .. we don't do
 this...) would get
  ((2 . 1) ((x+1) . 2))

 On the other hand, if we were adding ((1 . 1) ((x+1) . 2)) and
 ((1 . 1) ((x+1) . 3)), the common factor of x+1 would be obvious
 and we would get  ((1 . 1) ((x+1) . 2) ((x+2) . 1))
